# What are Orphan pages?
Orphan pages are website pages that are not linked to from any other page or section of your site. This means a user cannot access the page without knowing the direct URL. Additionally, these pages can't be followed from another page by search engine crawlers, which means they are rarely indexed by search engines.

## Why are orphaned pages bad?
* Low Rankings & Traffic: Even if they contain great content, orphan pages typically don’t rank well in SERPs or get much organic search traffic.
* They might deliver old content that you don’t want on your website and want to remove from your sitemap file, so as not to confuse both users and crawlers.
* They are useful and people keep visiting them via backlinks, but these pages miss out on the opportunity to receive enough traffic and link juice. If you add internal links to them, they will perform much better.
* They might be orphaned accidentally during a website migration. Determining if existing pages are still getting internal links is crucial.
